## About me

I was born in 1997 in Dorchester, Dorset. At the time my dad was in the army, therefore we moved around a lot when I was a baby. I lived in Bovington Camp, before moving to Wolfenbuttel (Germany), Catterick (Yorkshire) before my family settled down in Southport, Merseyside, in 1999. 

## Education

I went to my local primary school from 2001 to 2008, before moving to **Greenbank High School** (2008-2013) where I achieved A and B grades across 10 GCSEs.

For further education I studied at [King George V College](https://www.kgv.ac.uk/), Southport. For my A-Levels I achieved:
1. Biology - B
2. Geography - A*
3. Psychology - C

I stayed in Southport until 2015 when I decided to become a student at the [University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/) studying [BSc Geography](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/geography-bsc-hons/overview/). Over the next 3 years I built up my skills in:
- Written and verbal communication
- Laboratory work
- Collecting data and analysis in field
- GIS

#### The grades I received over second and third year resulted in me achieving a **First** class degree!

## Postgraduate Education

Now, I am a postgraduate student at the University of Liverpool where I am doing an integrated master/PhD course in Data Analytics and Society in the [Geographic Data Science Lab](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/geographic-data-science/).

My modules for the first year as a postgraduate include: *Social Survey Analysis*, *Spatial Analysis*, and *Qualitative Research Methods*. My course is linked with three other universities - University of Manchester, University of Leeds and University of Sheffield. Within each university we will complete one module, and these modules are called: *Programming for Social Sciences* (Leeds), *Analysis of Human Dynamics* (Liverpool), *Understanding Data and its Environment* (Manchester) and *Data Science for Social Science* (Sheffield).

For Leeds module, I have created an Agents Based Model (ABM) which shows agents interacting with neighbours and the environment... to see this click [here](agents.md).
