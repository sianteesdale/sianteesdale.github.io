</p>

Currently studying for my integrated Master's/PhD degree in Data Analytics and Society in the [Geographic Data Science Lab](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/geographic-data-science/) at the University of Liverpool. My project is **"The urban analytics of “human weather” form and forecast"** which is sponsored by Esri and Here.

## Education

For further education I studied at [King George V College](https://www.kgv.ac.uk/) where I achieved A-Levels in Biology (B), Geography (A*) and Psychology (C).
My A-Level choices resulted in me becoming a student at the [University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/) studying [BSc Geography](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/geography-bsc-hons/overview/). Over the next 3 years I built up my skills in:
- Written and verbal communication;
- Laboratory work;
- Collecting data and analysis in field;
- GIS;
- and many more

My degree led me to conduct fieldwork in Trawsfynydd and Grasmere in the UK, before conducting fieldwork further afield in Santa Cruz, California.

For more information about my third year dissertation project ("Assessing the Onshore Wind Energy Potential for North-West England"), go to my [dissertation page](dissertation.md).

The grades I received over second and third year resulted in me achieving a **First** class degree!

## Postgraduate Education

My modules for the first year as a postgraduate include: *Social Survey Analysis*, *Spatial Analysis*, and *Qualitative Research Methods*. My course is linked with three other universities - University of Manchester, University of Leeds and University of Sheffield. Within each university we will complete one module, and these modules are called: *Programming for Social Sciences* (Leeds), *Analysis of Human Dynamics* (Liverpool), *Understanding Data and its Environment* (Manchester) and *Data Science for Social Science* (Sheffield). I will also do an internship at one of my sponsors during Semester Two.

For the Leeds module, I have created an Agents Based Model (ABM) which shows agents interacting with neighbours and the environment... to see this click [here](leeds.md).
