## About me

Hi I'm Sian and I'm currently studying for my integrated Master's/PhD at the University of Liverpool! :)

## Education

For my high school education I went to **Greenbank High School** (2008-2013) where I achieved A and B grades across 10 GCSEs.

For further education I studied at [King George V College](https://www.kgv.ac.uk/), Southport. For my A-Levels I achieved:
1. Biology - B
2. Geography - A*
3. Psychology - C

My A-Level choices resulted in me becoming a student at the [University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/) studying [BSc Geography](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/geography-bsc-hons/overview/). Over the next 3 years I built up my skills in:
- Written and verbal communication
- Laboratory work
- Collecting data and analysis in field
- GIS

For more information about my third year dissertation project ("Assessing the Onshore Wind Energy Potential for North-West England"), go to my [dissertation page](dissertation.md).

#### The grades I received over second and third year resulted in me achieving a **First** class degree!

## Postgraduate Education

Now, I am a postgraduate student at the University of Liverpool where I am doing an integrated Master's/PhD course in Data Analytics and Society in the [Geographic Data Science Lab](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/geographic-data-science/) at the University of Liverpool. My project is **"The urban analytics of “human weather” form and forecast"** which is sponsored by Esri and Here.

My modules for the first year as a postgraduate include: *Social Survey Analysis*, *Spatial Analysis*, and *Qualitative Research Methods*. My course is linked with three other universities - University of Manchester, University of Leeds and University of Sheffield. Within each university we will complete one module, and these modules are called: *Programming for Social Sciences* (Leeds), *Analysis of Human Dynamics* (Liverpool), *Understanding Data and its Environment* (Manchester) and *Data Science for Social Science* (Sheffield).

For Leeds module, I have created an Agents Based Model (ABM) which shows agents interacting with neighbours and the environment... to see this click [here](agents.md).
